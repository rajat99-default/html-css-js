            <h2>About Bhopal</h2>
            <p style="color: white;"> 
                Bhopal, the capital city of the Indian state of Madhya Pradesh, is a historic and culturally rich metropolis. Nestled in the heart of the country, Bhopal is known for its amalgamation of traditional charm and modernity. The city's history dates back to the 11th century when it was founded by the Parmar ruler Raja Bhoj, from whom it derives its name.
                
                Bhopal is renowned for its picturesque lakes, with the Upper Lake and Lower Lake being prominent features that enhance the city's natural beauty. These lakes not only serve as tranquil spots for recreation but also contribute to the city's unique identity. The historic significance of Bhopal is evident in its architecture, with the iconic Taj-ul-Masajid, one of the largest mosques in Asia, and the Shaukat Mahal reflecting the city's cultural and architectural diversity.
